# DBC Final Project Voting System

This is an app that was started during my time at Dev Bootcamp in a group project (shoutout to peanutenthusiast, nestro14, garimaj2108, and rnose512 for being great contributors). Upon graduating, I have decided to work on this project a little more and work out the bugs that we did not have the time to fix. 

This app allows students to pitch their final projects ideas and to vote on the pitches. 

There is also admin capability, where admins can choose the final projects as well as set up teams for each project. 

Users will need to sign into their account in order to pitch an idea and vote for a pitch.
