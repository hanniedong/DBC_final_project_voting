# Pitchify: A DBC Final Project Voting System

This is an app that was started during my time at Dev Bootcamp in a group project (shoutout to peanutenthusiast, nestro14, garimaj2108, and rnose512 for being great contributors). Upon graduating, I have decided to work on this project a little more and work out the bugs that we did not have the time to fix including the logic for creating new votes, rounds, and teams. 

<strong>This app allows students to pitch their final projects ideas and to vote on the pitches. </strong>
